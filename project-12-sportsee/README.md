3. Open two terminals in Visual Studio Code, one for the backend folder, the other one for the frontend folder

   - On the first one, type the following commands :

     - `npm install --global yarn` to install all of the backend dependencies

   - Do the same on the second terminal :

     - `cd ./app` to access the frontend folder
     - `npm install --global yarn` to install all of the backend dependencies

   - Once all of the dependencies are installed, type the following commands in the backend terminal : `yarn dev` and wait for the message "Magic happens on port 3000" to display
   - Then in the frontend terminal type : `yarn start`.

4. There are two user ids : `12` and `18`. To access a working user page the correct URLs are
